# Research-Reports

As an active AI researcher, most of my work is tied up with NDA. Under appropriate permission, I will share some of our research work and reports in this repository. 

List of Reports:

1. UHN Paper Abstracts (Multiple)
2. Federated Learning - Study on Performance Limitations
3. Hyperpartisan News Detection

=====================================================================================================================================================

Update on the Hyperpartisan News Detection*: 

I made significant experiement code changes to the project after it was abandoned. I took the initiative, updated the incorrect experiment, paper, and submitted the work fully validating all the results as of Jan 2nd, 2025. I have updated the report, repo based on new experiments to reflect the same.
