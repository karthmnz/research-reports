# Research-Reports

As an active AI researcher, most of my work is tied up with NDA. Under appropriate permission, I will share some of our research work and reports in this repository. 

List of Reports:

1. UHN Paper Abstracts (Multiple)
2. Federated Learning - Study on Performance Limitations
3. Hyperpartisan News Detection

=====================================================================================================================================================

Update on the Hyperpartisan News Detection*: 

I made significant experiment code changes to the project after it was abandoned. I updated the incorrect experiments, paper, and submitted the work fully validating all the results as of Jan 2nd, 2025. I have updated the report, repo based on new experiments to reflect the same. 


** The second author (P Chen) did not contribute to the work after October 2020, but their preliminary work is acknowledged and is still maintained as co-author to recognize their earlier work between August 2020 and October 2020.
