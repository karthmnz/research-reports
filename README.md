# Research-Reports

As an active AI researcher, most of my work is tied up with NDAs. I will share some of our lab's reports and research work that has been released in this catch all repository. 

List of Reports:

1. UHN Paper Abstracts (Multiple)
2. Federated Learning - Study on Performance Limitations
3. Hyperpartisan News Detection

=====================================================================================================================================================

Update on the Hyperpartisan News Detection*: 

I made significant experimental code changes to the project after it was abandoned. I corrected the erroneous experiments and paper, and submitted the work fully validating all the corrected results as of Jan 2nd, 2025. I have updated the report, repository based on the new experiments to reflect the same.
