# Research-Reports

As an active AI researcher, most of my work is tied up with NDA. Under appropriate permission, I will share some of our research work and reports in this repository. 

List of Reports:

1. UHN Paper Abstracts (Multiple)
2. Federated Learning - Study on Performance Limitations
3. Hyperpartisan News Detection

=========================================================================================================================================================================

Update on the Hyperpartisan News: 

I made significant experiement code changes to the project after it was left untouched, I took the initiative, updated the paper, and resubmitted the work fully validating all the results. And I have update the contributions in the newer report to reflect the same as I spent a lot of time updating the experiment over the past few weeks.
